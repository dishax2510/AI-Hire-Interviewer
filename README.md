## Project Overview

AI-Hire Interviewer is an innovative, full-stack simulated AI interview platform designed to assist developers in preparing for technical roles. It goes beyond traditional mock interviews by providing real-time response analysis, leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to evaluate both technical conceptual understanding and communication effectiveness. The platform aims to offer candidates a comprehensive and objective assessment, helping them refine their interview skills.

## Features

* **Simulated Interview Environment:** Interactive platform to simulate a technical interview experience.
* **Real-time Response Capture:** Records candidate's spoken or typed responses to interview questions.
* **Technical Concept Analysis:** Utilizes **BERT** to assess the accuracy, depth, and relevance of technical explanations within responses.
* **Communication Evaluation:** Employs **spaCy** for linguistic analysis, evaluating clarity, coherence, and conciseness of communication.
* **Candidate Management:** Secure dashboard for candidates to manage their profiles, view interview history, and access detailed feedback.
* **Interview Management (Admin/Recruiter Side - *Planned/In-progress*):** [Describe features for recruiters/admins, e.g., create interview questions, view candidate reports.]
* **User Authentication:** Secure login system [mention if OTP, email/pass etc.].

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
* **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Next.js:** A React framework for production-ready applications, enabling server-side rendering and API routes.
* **TypeScript:** (If used for type-safety) For robust and scalable frontend development.

### Backend
* **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
* **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
* **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage (candidate profiles, interview data, responses).
* **Mongoose:** An elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.

### AI/NLP
* **Python:** The primary language for NLP processing.
* **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):** For deep understanding and analysis of technical concepts in text.
* **spaCy:** For efficient natural language processing tasks, including tokenization, linguistic analysis, and named entity recognition.
* **[Speech-to-Text Library/API - e.g., AssemblyAI, Google Speech-to-Text, Whisper]:** (Mention if you integrate this for voice input processing).

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm or Yarn
* Python (3.8+)
* pip (Python package installer)
* MongoDB Atlas account or local MongoDB instance
